<summary>Installation of Openlane</summary>
  
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. It also provides a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.  

Before installing Openlane, we should first install its dependencies:
  
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip make git
```
Docker Installation:

```
# Remove old installations
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Installation of requirements
sudo apt-get install \
   ca-certificates \
   curl \
   gnupg \
   lsb-release

# Add the keyrings of docker
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the package repository
echo \
   "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update the package repository
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# Check for installation
sudo docker run hello-world

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot

# After reboot
docker run hello-world
```
Now download Openlane from Github:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
cd OpenLane/
make
make test
cd /home/rachana/OpenLane/designs/ci
cp -r * ../
```

**Installation of OpenSTA:**  

Use the following commands to checkout the git repository and build the OpenSTA library and excutable.
```
#installing dependencies for OpenSTA
sudo apt-get install cmake clang gcc tcl swig bison flex

#installing OpenSTA
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA.git
cd OpenSTA
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

<summary>SoC Design and Openlane</summary>
Application Specific Integrated Circuit(ASIC) consists of 3 main parts:  
  
  - RTL IP's
  - EDA Tools
  - PDK Data  
  
In short, it can be implemented as below:  
  
![](https://github.com/Rachana-Kaparthi/ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/blob/main/images/asic_elements.png)

The main objective of ASIC is to convert the code from RTL level to GDSII which is used for final layout process.GDSII stream format (GDSII), is a binary database file format which is the de facto industry standard for Electronic Design Automation data exchange of integrated circuit or IC layout artwork.  

**Simplified  RTL to GDSII Flow**
![](https://github.com/Rachana-Kaparthi/ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/blob/main/images/rtl_to_gdsii.png)
*Synthesis:*

Convert your RTL code into a gate-level netlist using synthesis tools such as Yosys. This step generates a logical representation of your design using standard cells from a library.  

*Floor Planning:*

Define the physical layout of the chip, including the placement of functional blocks, I/O pads, and power grid distribution. This step helps determine the chip's overall size and shape.  

*Power Planning:*

Implement the power distribution network to provide stable power to all parts of the design while minimizing voltage drop. Tools like OpenSTA can be used for static timing analysis to ensure proper power distribution.  
Placement:

Place the synthesized logical cells onto the chip's floorplan. Tools like RePLace or Graywolf can be used for placement.  
Placement is usually done in two steps:  

- Global Placement
- Detailed PLacement

*Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):*

Generate a clock distribution network that ensures clock signals reach all parts of the design with minimal skew. Typically, OpenLane's TritonCTS is used for this purpose.It ususally takes the shape of a tree..  

*Routing:*

Create the physical interconnections (metal layers) between the placed cells while adhering to design rules. This step is performed using a router like FastRoute or TritonRoute.  
Metal Layer form a routing grid which is huge, hence we use divide and conquer methodology for routing grid.  
Global Routing: Generates routing grids  
Detailed Routing: Uses the routing guides to implement the actual wiring  

*Sign Off:*  

This includes physical and Timing verifications.  
- *Physical verifications:*
  - *Design Rule Checking (DRC):*
    - Verify that the chip layout adheres to the manufacturing process's design rules. DRC tools like Magic or KLayout are commonly used for this purpose.
  - *Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) Check:*
    - Ensure that the final layout matches the original schematic. LVS tools like Netgen or Calibre are used to compare the netlist extracted from the layout with the synthesized netlist.
- *Timing verifications:*
  - *Static Timing Analysis (STA):*
    - Analyze the timing characteristics of your design to ensure that all setup and hold time requirements are met. OpenSTA is commonly used in the OpenLane flow for STA.
      
**Opensource ASIC flow**  

The OpenLANE flow utilizes tools mainly from the OpenROAD, YosysHQ, and Open Circuit Design projects. The way those tools are used, augmented by a number of other custom tools and scripts, defines the methodology of the flow.
OpenLANE supports two main use cases-  

- First, It can be used to harden designs from their RTL HDL models obtaining what we will refer to as soft macros
- The second use case is integrating macros into a complete chip.
  
To demonstrate its capabilities, OpenLANE has been used to successfully tape out a family of RISC-V based SoCs called striVe.

Below figure demonstrates the Openlane ASIC flow-  

![](https://github.com/Rachana-Kaparthi/ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/blob/main/images/openlane_asic_flow.png)  

 Below is a summarized breakdown of the stages seen in the figure:  
 
 A. RTL Synthesis and STA -The design is synthesized into a gate-level netlist using yosys and static timing analysis is performed on the resulting netlist using OpenSTA.  
 
 B. Insertion of DFT structures -An open-source Design For Testability (DFT) toolchain, Fault, can optionally be used to modify the netlist, inserting scan chains and the necessary IO ports to scan and test the design after fabrication.  
 
 C. Physical Implementation -Most of the tools in this stage are used from within the OpenROAD application in combination with other tools, some of them are custom and based on the OpenDB infrastructure,while others are indpendent.  
 
  D. Post-routing Evaluation of Results -DRC and LVS are then performed using magic and netgen .Antenna checking is performed by either OpenROADâ€™s ARC (Antenna Rule Checker) or using magic.  
  
**Open-Source EDA Tools**

**Steps to synthesis in OpenLane:**  
```
cd ~/OpenLane
make mount
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a
run_synthesis
```
After we run synthesis command, new folder named 'runs' will be created in the picorv32a directory where we find the simulation results, logs etc related to picorv32a synthesis.
Netlist of picorv32 can be seen here-  
```
cd /home/rachana/OpenLane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2023.09.09_15.50.10/results/synthesis

## Day 2 - Good flooplan vs Bad Floorplan and introduction to library cells  

<details>
  <summary>Chip Floor Planning considerations  </summary>  
  Two parameters are of importance when it comes to floorplanning namely, Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio. 
*Utilisation Factor:*  
 - The ratio of area occupied by the cells in the netlist to the total area of the core  
 - It is better to have a utilization Factor of 0.5 to 0.6 to accomodate any extra logic later on.
